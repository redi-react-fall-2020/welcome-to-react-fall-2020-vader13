# Welcome!

Welcome to the React Fall 2020 Class! We hope you are as excited as we are to get this semester going! 

## What is Githib Classroom and why is it useful
Github Classroom is a awesome way to organize assignments and homework for our class. When we have an assignment, we can invite you to the assignment and you can simply accept it with the click of a button! And when you are then working on the assignment we can see how your progress is going and support you right here on Github! Exciting!

## Today's assignment
Today's assignment is very simple. It is just meant to get you onboarded into this platform and make sure you have a Github account. So if you are seeing this message, you are already done.

## Bonus assignment
If you have a minute, you could try to add a new file to this repository right here on Github! Simply click "Add file" and then "Create new file" on the main page of this repository. 
In this new file, you could write a short sentence about who you are. When you are done, you can commit the new file to the repository at the bottom of the page. Try it out!
